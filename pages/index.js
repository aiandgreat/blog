        <p>Hi! I'm Aian Jae Garcia, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at the University of the Assumption. I live in Guemasan Arayat, Pampanga. My hobbies include going to the gym and studying. Additionally, my favorite songs by Linkin Park are "Iridescent," "Somewhere I Belong," and "What I've Done." When it comes to food, my favorite is authentic pork sisig with eggs. In five years, I see myself working in the tech industry as a web developer or a cybersecurity analyst. </p>
